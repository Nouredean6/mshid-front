      Murshid is a premier Moroccan travel website that was founded in 2023 with the aim of connecting travelers with the rich cultural heritage and natural beauty of Morocco. The idea behind Murshid was born out of a deep passion for showcasing the diverse and enchanting experiences that this North African gem has to offer. Our founders, a group of seasoned travelers and Moroccan locals, recognized the need for a reliable platform that would help visitors navigate the country's vibrant destinations, unique traditions, and hidden treasures.
